Known
	timer bus clock freq	=  4 [MHz]	(APB1 clock)
	timer accuracy  		= 16 [bit]	(Timer 1)
	pwm freq   			    = 50 [Hz]	(motor spec.)
	pulse duration accuracy =  1 [us]	(motor spec., to be verified)

Unknown
	prescaler = ?
	counter period = ?
	timer accuracy is enough? 
	

Solving
	timer clock duration = pulse duration accuracy

	timer clock freq = 1 / pulse duration accuracy

	timer clock freq = 1 / 0.000001 [s] = 1 000 000 [Hz]

	timer clock freq = timer bus clock freq / prescaler

	prescaler = timer bus clock freq / timer clock freq

		prescaler = 4 000 000 [Hz] / 1 000 000 [Hz] = 4

	counter period = (timer clock freq / pwm freq) - 1

		counter period = (1 000 000 [Hz] / 50 [Hz]) - 1 = 19 999

	timer accuracy is enough?
	
	log2(counter period) = log2(20 000) = 15 bit <= 16bit (timer accuracy)

		timer accuracy is enough!
